== Diaspora Cluster Manager

[[http://www.vsca.ca/Diaspora/|//Diaspora//]] is a hard science-fiction role-play game based on the //[[http://www.faterpg.com/|FATE]]// system.

One day you will be able to use this application to create and edit your star cluster, link them, assign their aspect, etcetera. 

This is just a preliminary commit, so that I can access the code from wherever I am. It is in no way functional nor close to completion.
